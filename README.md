# SE-Assignment
Raffles University BAI21113 Software Engineering Assignment work

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Python and Tkinter. It provides users with an easy-to-use interface to input their weight and height and calculates their BMI. The result categorizes the user's BMI into underweight, normal, overweight, or obesity.

## 🚀 Features
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.
- Real-time BMI calculation based on user input.
- Clear BMI categorization (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obesity).

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
- Github Desktop clone https://github.com/MinYuOuO/SE-Assignment.git
- git clone git@github.com:MinYuOuO/SE-Assignment.git
- gh repo clone MinYuOuO/SE-Assignment

2. Install used library
- pip install tk

3. Run the application:
- python Main.py


## 📖 Iteration Report
### Iteration 1: Basic BMI Calculation
- Implemented the core function `BMI_Cal(weight, height)`, which calculates BMI and categorizes the result.
- Created a simple Tkinter GUI for user input and display of results.

### Iteration 2: Error Handling & UI Enhancement
- Added error handling for invalid inputs and zero height.
- Improved result text styling for better readability.
- Implemented input validation to ensure numerical values.

### Iteration 3: Modularization & Code Optimization
- Moved BMI calculation logic to a separate function (`Function.py`) to improve modularity.
- Enhanced UI responsiveness.
- Ensured proper layout and alignment of GUI components.

### Iteration 4 & 5: Updated README Documentation
- fix iteration 3,4 wrong commit
- update correct documentation

### Iteration 6: Updated Main Function
- fix invalid calculation that set with wrong height

## 🌱 Branching and Merging Strategy
We used a structured branching approach:
- `main`: Main interface of the project.
- `feature/ui-enhancements`: Added UI improvements and styling updates.
- `feature/error-handling`: Introduced better error handling.
- Merging was performed via pull requests to ensure code reviews before integrating changes into the `main` branch.
