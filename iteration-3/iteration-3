# BMI Calculator

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Python and Tkinter. It provides users with an easy-to-use interface to input their weight and height and calculates their BMI. The result categorizes the user's BMI into underweight, normal, overweight, or obesity.

## 🚀 Features
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.
- Real-time BMI calculation based on user input.
- Clear BMI categorization (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obesity).
- Input validation and error handling.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bmi-calculator
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📖 Iteration Report
### Iteration 1: Basic BMI Calculation
- Implemented the core function `BMI_Cal(weight, height)`, which calculates BMI and categorizes the result.
- Created a simple Tkinter GUI for user input and display of results.

### Iteration 2: Error Handling & UI Enhancement
- Added error handling for invalid inputs and zero height.
- Improved result text styling for better readability.
- Implemented input validation to ensure numerical values.

### Iteration 3: Modularization & Code Optimization
- Moved BMI calculation logic to a separate function (`Function.py`) to improve modularity.
- Enhanced UI responsiveness.
- Ensured proper layout and alignment of GUI components.

## 🌱 Branching and Merging Strategy
We used a structured branching approach:
- `main`: Stable version of the project.
- `feature/ui-enhancements`: Added UI improvements and styling updates.
- `feature/error-handling`: Introduced better error handling.
- Merging was performed via pull requests to ensure code reviews before integrating changes into the `main` branch.

## 📌 Kanban Board
A Kanban board was used to manage project tasks efficiently:
- **To-Do**: Listed upcoming tasks such as feature development and bug fixes.
- **In Progress**: Tracked ongoing tasks.
- **Completed**: Marked finished tasks for better visibility.
- **Reflection**: The Kanban board improved task organization and workflow efficiency.
